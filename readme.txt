Ever forget to consistently apply trademark symbols to your trademarked phrases or brands?  Brand-Marker allows you to list out your brands, select the appropriate trademark symbol and rest assured that they will be applied in every page, or post that you publish.  No more mistaken or forgotten trademark symbols.

Brand-Marker will parse your posts on the fly and ensure that the appropriate trademark symbol follows them.  This will apply to the title, content and excerpt of the post.  With support for up to five brands, being case insensitive, and both trademark symbols, you and your bloggers will not need to worry about trademark symbols on your brands again!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

To ensure you don't wind up with two trademark symbols, add "Brand X" as the first brand in the settings page and put "Brand X Y" afterwards.

That's okay.  Brand Marker will remove any existing trademark symbols from brands that you specify prior to applying the appropriate trademark symbol.
